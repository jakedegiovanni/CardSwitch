# CardSwitch

UPDATE AS OF SATURDAY NIGHT:
Updated the background pictures and declared them in the basicfunctions.py
file. Haven't been able to implement them in the actual game. Help with this
tomorrow would be good. Not too sure how to do it although that might just
be because I need sleep. 

Also not been able to figure out how to get the "Answer now" text to appear
only after the cards have all been shown. Tried a lot of stuff for this but
nothing worked. YAY!

Can't think of anything else...need sleep.
